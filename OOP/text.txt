Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

1> we define a class 
class{
    name
    email
    password
login(){
    //Login login
 }
}

    ⬇️

{
    user:'john'
    email:'sss@hhh.com'
    password:'12344'

    login(){
    //Login login
 }
}

----------------------------------------------------

2> Principles for OOP

* Abstraction ==> To hide the details which don't matters to a user means to hide some back details from main user which he not cares for. 

* Encapsulation ==>  Keeping properties and method private inside the class which is not access able from outside class. 

* Inheritance  ==> If we have too class with some same properities and we don't want to duplicate the code then we just inherit the parent class in child class.  

* Polymorphism ==> A child class can overwrite a method it inherit from a parent class. 

---------------------------------------------------

3 > OOP in Java script

       Prototype 
          ⬆
        Objects

Prototype Inheritance ===>  The Prototype contains method(behavior) that are accessible to all object linked to that Prototype.

#### In Js there are three method to implement OOp ####

* Constructor Function ---> Technique to create object from   a function. Like Array, Maps, Sets etc.

* ES6 Classes ---> Just modern syntax to do the same stuff.

* Object.create ---> Same but easy
